Simulation in Webots Software of a custom robot that Moves around a maze Using LSRB algorithm




LSRB Algorithm
This LSRB algorithm can be simplified into these simple conditions:
If you can turn left then go ahead and turn left,
else if you can continue driving straight then drive straight,
else if you can turn right then turn right.
If you are at a dead end then turn around.

The expunction of LSRB is shown below:
L- Left
R- Right
S- Straight
B- Turning around (Back).
